# CurrencyRouletteGame.py
# This game will use q free currency api to get the current exchange rate from USD to ILS.
# Will generate a new random number between 1-100 and will ask the user what he thinks is the value of
# the generated number from USD to ILS, depending on the userâ€™s difficulty his answer will be
# correct if the guessed value is between the interval surrounding the correct answer
#
# Properties
# Difficulty: 1 - 50%, 2 - 49.5%, 3 - 49%, 4 - 48.5%, ... 98 - 2%, 99 - 1.5%, 100 - 1%

# Methods
# 1. get_money_interval -Will get the current currency rate from USD to ILS and will
# generate an interval as follows:
# a. for given difficulty d, and total value of money t the interval will be: (t - (5 - d), t +
# (5 - d))
#
# 2. get_guess_from_user - A method to prompt a guess from the user to enter a guess of
# value to a given amount of USD
# 3. play - Will call the functions above and play the game. Will return True / False if the user
# lost or won.
